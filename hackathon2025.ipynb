This indicates a principal repayment towards a loan. While the exact amount repaid isn't explicitly stated (the difference between old and new principal is larger than 11794), the core action is a principal payment being received by the bank.\n",

The attachment titled \"Payment_Receipt.pdf\" further supports this being a principal repayment. While the email mentions a \"Loan\", there is no mention of interest or fees being paid, focusing solely on the change in principal balance.  This aligns with an inbound principal payment from Sophia White LP to Kishkinda Bank.\n",

This indicates a principal repayment towards a loan, which constitutes an inbound money movement for Kishkinda Bank.  While the specific currency amount of 11006 is not explicitly labeled as USD, the context strongly suggests it refers to USD given the subject line mentioning \"USD 205\" and the \"Current Principal Balance: USD 57689\" and \"New Principal Balance: USD 25892\" lines. The attachment named \"Payment_Receipt.pdf\" further supports this being a payment. The reduction in the principal balance confirms this is a principal repayment and not interest or fees.\n"
